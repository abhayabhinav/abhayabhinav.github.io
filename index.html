    <h1>Fuel Efficiency - Narrative Visualization</h1>
    <p>
      This visualization can help readers explore fuel efficiency of cars based
      on fuel type and engine cylinders. I would like my readers to know a
      little bit about the data set used to create this narrative visualization.
      The cars data set contains following attributes - Car Make, Fuel Type,
      Engine Cylinders, Average Highway Mileage Per Gallon and Average City
      Mileage Per Gallon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visual structure is as follows: There is a "Start - Visualization"
      button, the readers can click on this start button to begin the journey.
      There are three scenes available , where I am going to lead the readers to
      each of these three scenes as they click on the respective buttons. A
      Scatter Plot of Avg City Mileage and Avg Highway Mileage is displayed on
      each of these three scenes. Scene 1 - "Overview - All Fuel Type", all data
      is displayed to give an overview. Scene 2 - "Diesel - Fuel Type", diesel
      only data is presented. Scene 3 - "Electricity - Fuel Type", Electricity
      only data is presented. In each of these scenes readers can gauge the fuel
      efficiency of the cars by fuel type.
    </p>
    <p>
      When readers finally reaches on Scene 3, "Electricity - Fuel Type", there
      are filtering options available on Fuel Type and Engine Cylinders to allow
      readers to perform a free form exploration to find fuel efficient cars.
      Please note Engine Cylinders drop down gets enabled only when Fuel Type is
      selected. Once readers begin their journey, there is always a "Stop -
      Visualization" button available to reset the stage and start the journey
      again. Hope you all have fun! Plese begin by clicking the
      "Start-Visualization"!
