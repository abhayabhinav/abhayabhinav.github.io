    <h1>Fuel Efficiency - Narrative Visualization</h1>
    <p>
      This visualization can help readers to analyze fuel efficiency of cars
      based on fuel type and engine cylinders. The idea is to help readers
      choose a fuel efficient car of their liking keeping carbon footprint in
      mind. Before I explain about narrative and visual structure I would like
      to describe little bit about the data set. The cars data set contains the
      following attributes - Car Make, Fuel Type, Engine Cylinders, Average
      Highway Mileage Per Gallon and Average City Mileage Per Gallon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visual structure is as follows: There is a "Start Visualization"
      button to begin the journey. It will open 3 more buttons or tabs, we can
      also call them as scenes. All the three scenes have a scatter plot graph
      representing Average Highway Mileage Per Gallon and Average City Mileage
      Per Gallon for the cars. Readers can navigate to each of these scenes by
      clicking on the respective buttons and will be guided with a pre filtered
      data on fuel type on each of these scenes. Scene 1 is - "Overview - All
      Fuel Type", all data is displayed to give an overview. Scene 2 -
      "Gasoline", filtered by fuel type Gasoline. Scene 3 - "Electricity",
      filtered by fuel type Electricity. In each of these scenes readers can
      gauge the fuel efficiency of the cars. There are information available on
      mouse hover which conveys about the Engine Cylinder and the Car Make along
      with annotations highlighting correlation between engine cylinders and
      fuel efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Scene 3, there are filtering options available on Fuel Type and Engine
      Cylinders to allow for free exploration. Engine Cylinders is enabled only
      when a Fuel Type is selected and is also a cascaded dropdown. The list of
      values in Engine Cylinders depends on Fuel Type selected. Please know the
      "Start Visualization" button changes to "Stop - Visualization" as you
      begin and is available for the readers to reset the stage. Hope you all
      find this visualization exciting and be able to choose a fuel efficient
      car make for yourself keeping low carbon footprint!
